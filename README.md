## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure the functionality and security of my code, program, or software, I typically engage in comprehensive testing. This includes JUnit testing, coverage testing, and security testing. Along with testing, following best practices for coding is crucial. Secure coding techniques, updating libraries and dependencies, and implementing proper access controls are all important steps to take. By taking these measures, I can help ensure that my code is functional and secure.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs involves gathering requirements through research, interviews, surveys, and usability testing. These requirements are then organized and prioritized into a requirements document. Next, they can be integrated into the program's design, development, and testing phases. Throughout the development process, regular user feedback and testing should be conducted to ensure the program effectively meets the user's needs.

## How do I approach designing software?
When approaching software design, I first define the problem or opportunity the software will need address. Next, I consider the end-users and their needs, as well as any relevant technical constraints. From there, brainstorm potential solutions and create prototypes to test and refine any ideas. Finally, I document the software design and create a plan for its development and eventually follow through with actually implementing the plan.
